# AI Usage Documentation

This project was built with assistance from AI tooling (Cursor AI) to accelerate implementation. All output was reviewed, tested, and refined manually.

## AI-Assisted Tasks

1. **Initial project scaffolding** – workspace scripts, backend/frontend bootstrapping.
2. **Backend API design** – controllers, services, middleware, and Prisma schema.
3. **Frontend UI/UX** – Studio layout, Material UI integration, and prompt workflow.
4. **Testing scaffolds** – Jest, Vitest, and Playwright configuration with sample specs.
5. **DevOps** – GitHub Actions pipeline and documentation polish.

## Human Oversight

- Verified TypeScript types, lint rules, and formatting.
- Expanded automated tests and ensured deterministic behaviour.
- Manually exercised the application end-to-end after significant changes.
- Reworded copy and documentation for clarity.
